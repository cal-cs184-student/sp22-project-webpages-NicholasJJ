    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, I implemented 1d and 2d bezier curves, and then implemented several useful functions for manipulating and rendering triangle meshes. Bezier curves
      are a useful tool for rendering curved things. They don't take up much memory (just a handful of points can describe a very specific curve), can be moved along with 
      respect to a single parameter, and can be calculated with a simple recursive algorithm. Part 1 was simply to implement this algorithm, and part 2 generalized the algorithm
      to 2 dimensions, allowing an array of points to describe a "Bezier Surface" that allows for a smooth rendering of a 3d object. Unfortunatley, although the algorithm for drawing
      bezier curves is simple to implement, it's recursive nature means it's computationally intensive, especially in 2 dimensions. In Part 3, to render smooth shapes without using Bezier
      curves, I implemented a function to average the normals of verticies using the normals of their faces, weighted by area. This removes the sharp normal (and thus lighting) changes at the verticies
      and results in a mesh rendering that looks smooth. The next 3 parts were all centered around manipulating the mesh itself, leading up to a final algorithm to subdivide and smooth
      out any mesh. In parts 4 and 5 I implemented edge flipping and edge splitting by carefully reasigning the pointers/iterators of the elements of the half-edge data structure and, when 
      neccecary, creating new elements for the structure. In part 6 I used the functions defined in the previous parts to implement the algorithm described in lecture to subdivide a mesh surface, utilising
      the provided fields of the data structure to pre-compute the eventual vertex positions pre-splitting in order to simplify the algorithm.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>de Casteljau's Algorithm is a way to create a Bezier curve using induction. Starting with a set of n control points defining
      the curve and a float t between 0 and 1, the algorithm lerps creates a new set of n-1 points by lerping between each adjacent origional point
      by n. It then lerps between adjacent points in the n-1 points to create a new set of n-2 points, and so on until it reaches a single point, which is 
      on the curve. This point is also the interpolation along the curve by t. The recursive framework of the algorithm is already implemented,
      so all I did to implement the algorithm is write the recursive step of creating a new std::vector and populating it with the interpolations by t of each
      pair of adjacent points in the input vector.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>
      The de Casteljau Algorithm generalizes from a Bezier curve to a Bezier surface by running the algorithm twice, once of the "rows" and once for the "columns".
      Imagine the control points for the surface are control points for a series of horizontal and vertical bezier curves. These curves would form a sort of latice that
      roughly defines the shape of the surface. All the generalized de Casteljau Algorithm does is calculate a series of points on the horizontal bezier curves with the same
      interpolation value (roughly the same "horizontal" location or column) and then use these points as a new curve to find a point with the given "vertical" location.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

    <p>
      I implemented area weighted vertex normals by summing and normalizing the cross-products of each adjacent pair of vectors radiating from the vertex.
      To get the Vector pairs, for each face the vector is a part of, I subtracted the central vertex position from the positions of the other two verticies.
      The cross product of two vectors is orthogonal to both vectors and has the magnitude of the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors.
      The area of the triangle formed by these two vectors (i.e. the face that the vectors belong to) has half the area of the parallelogram, but 
      since this multiple is applied to all faces it won't affect the weighting and can be ignored. This means each cross product is the normal of the face, 
      weighted by the area of the face, which is exactly what we need! After summing the cross products, I normalized the vector to get the final normal vector.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

    <p>
      My implementation strategy follows the implementation guide pdf's suggestion and makes every assignment as explicite as possible. I first create a variable for each mesh element related
      to the flip, and then reassign each element based on a diagram I wrote down on some scratch paper. My only implementation/debugging "trick" is to stick
      to the algorithm to keep things as simple as possible.

    <p>
      I had a very humbling debugging journey. At first I thought that I could save some time by attempting to lable the halfedges post-flip such that 
      I'd have to reassign as few pointers as possible. A bug popped up where the program crashed every time I tried to flip anything. After trying in vain
      to find the bug I decided to re-write the pointer assignments completely explicitly, and since I would be assigning everything again (even if the pointer
      didn't change), I just used the layout shown in the implementation guide pdf. Unfortunatley, I wasn't able to experience the easier debugging experience promised by
      the pdf because the new code worked first try.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

    <p>
      I implemented the edge split operation similar to how I implemented the flip operation: very carefully. I used scratch paper to write down the initital variables, and the new values
      they should have after the split, then I carefully wrote these in code. The only novel problem of this part was finding the position of the new vertex,
      which I did by averaging the position of the "top" and "bottom" vertecies in the diagram. The only implementation "trick" I used was re-using the initial variable lables from part 4,
      so that I could simply copy+paste that part of the code.

      Fortunatly, my code worked correctly the first time, so I have no debugging journey to share.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

    <p>
      To implement loop subdivision, I followed the advice of the comments in the code and first calculate the new positions of each vertex, then add edges, flip, and reposition the verticies.
      Calculating the new positions was just a matter of following the equations from lecture, writing down example meshes on paper to plot out a reliable "path" on how I could update the halfedge in the loop.
      Splitting edges turned out to be the trickiest part of this task. On the one hand, it makes sense to mark all the edges made/covered by the split as a new edge, since this 
      would allow the loop to terminate eventually. However, doing this winds up labeleing all edges as "new", and in the next step I wanted a way to differentiate new edges from old ones so that I would only flip
      truly new edges. I tried implementing this a few ways, but eventually opted for the simplest solution and just added a new bool to the edge class called "isNovel" that only refers to the edges that were not visibly
      there pre-split. So the two edges created along the initial split edge are "new" but not "novel" and the edges that cut across the old edge are both "new" AND "novel". It's only the novel
      edges that we want to consider flipping, so I use that variable in the flipping step. I went with this solution since it doesn't require any knowledge that has to be derived on paper, or any knowledge of
      how other class methods work.
    </p>


    <p>
      Under subdivision, sharp edges become less sharp. This is expected, since the point of this sort of subdivision is to "smooth out" a surface,
      which means making all edges less sharp. The best way to reduce this effect would probably be to add a feature to the program to make subdivision
      not alter the verticies of certain edges, like what was discussed in lecture. Only using pre-splitting, the best system I could find was to pre-split the nearby
      edges to the sharp edges neighboring faces get split up a lot. This causes the face to to deform much under subdivision, which keeps the edge looking sharp.
      Splitting the sharp edge itself sometimes produced a crowning effect that didn't look right, so I tried to avoid this. I've also included
      an example of

    <p>
      The asymmetry in the cube occurs because, while the geometry of the cube is symmetric, the topology of the cube was asymmetric.
      Since subdivision depends on geometry AND topology (e.g. old verticies are updated based on their neighboring verticies, which are determined
      by the mesh topology) this asymmetry becomes apparent in the resulting subdivision geometry. To fix the asymmetry, I made the topology symmetric.
      To do this I split each of the diagonal edges running across the faces of the cube, so that each face was composed of 4 symmetric triangles.
